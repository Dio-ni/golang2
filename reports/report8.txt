as planned this week we added the functionality that stores user id into local storage(it will be changed),
- after login it sends id and name to main page where it saves into localstorage
- we added form to send comments
- it posts the data ( 
        userId: which gets from localstorage,
        productId: from url value product:{id} 
        comment : from textarea) to sendComment which check if comment empty or not and after checking stores it to out comments table
- to make it easier we rewrite our productPage functoin into 3:
        - renderProductPage main one
        - getProduct to get exact one product full information
        - getComments to get comment to of product 
- after comment were sent it just reloaded product page
