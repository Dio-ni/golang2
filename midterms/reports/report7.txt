Report6 :
we looked at the structure and slightly changed and improved it. 

- we have divided some common functions into a separate method. 
- we added an array of routes containing paths and handlers for each endpoint. 
- create a separate function to handle the database connection and query logic, and then call it from both ProductsHandle and the SearchPage handler. 
- we added a form to the front for filtering by price, which gives a list of products in the interval specified in the filter (min and max). 
- We also added a function that reads this form and sends a response. To do this, we separately pulled out the function(method) executes a SQL query to retrieve the products that match the specified price range


there are plans to add a jwt token and then add comments. 
-Create an additional table with comments
- the ability to open each product to a separate page
- upload all product information there through the select join of these two tables.
