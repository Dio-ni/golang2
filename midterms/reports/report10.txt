that week we comlited some functionality as showing ratings andsend rate


now we getProduct with its
-main info
-comments
-rating which user already send(if user logged)

In Index.html link "read more" has been changed to form with post method
it sends userId from localStorage(which has saved after logging in)
After that backend gets userId from form to check its given rating to that product 
Shows already sent rating (of the user) with some js code in Product Page shows its rate as starts.

filtring by price and rating works well as commentimg and rating 
there left some thing to comlite the project
